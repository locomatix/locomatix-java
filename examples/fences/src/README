FencesExample:

This is a simple program demonstrating geo-fences. Basically, the program creates circular geo-fences of 2KM radius around 10 walmart stores in the Bay Area. Then it creates 10 customers and moves them into geo-fence so that the alerts are triggered. The script also contains code for creating polygonal fences around the store and the coordinates of polygons around the stores.


Files:

webserver.py --- this script is nothing but a simple python web server that listens on server, port for receiving alerts.

FencesExample.java ---- this scripts creates the store fences and customers and moves customers to stores so that alert will be triggered.


Requirements:

This example requires the Locomatix sdk which can be built by running ant from the root sdk directory (locomatix-java).


Running the example:

1) Start the webserver.py on a publicly reachable machine.
   
   python webserver.py
   
   The web server will print: Alerts are being received at <some url>
   Copy this url.

2) Open FencesExample.java and fill in the following variables:
   
   private final String CUSTOMERID = "<enter your locomatix custid>";
   private final String CUSTOMERKEY = "<enter your locomatix custkey>";
   private final String SECRETKEY = "<enter your locomatix secretkey>";

   private final String HOST = "<enter host>"; (usually api.locomatix.com)

   Compile the program
   ant
   
   Run the program with the url from the webserver
   ant -Dcallbackurl="<url from webserver>" run

   Once the program is started you will start seeing alerts in the webserver window.
